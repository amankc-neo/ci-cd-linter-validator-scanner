## üîç Overview

This tool acts as a pre-merge gatekeeper for CI/CD pipeline definitions (like GitHub Actions), ensuring:

- YAML linting and schema checks
- Enforcement of best practices (e.g., no `latest` tags, job isolation)
- Security policy checks using Open Policy Agent (OPA) + Rego
- Seamless GitHub Action integration for PR validation
